This is a windows form that allows the administrator to add new users
to their database. In this example I have a table called tUsers that 
holds some basic information about the person. This is in early 
devlopment, I still have to allow a user to log in with the credentials
provided by the database, but it is functional. 

*Important*
Put the database file in the C:\Temp folder. When you start the form,
it will ask you for a file name, just enter in the title of the database
and click the button next to it, it will update the connection string.
This application is exclusive to a table titled "tUserInfo". Not super
universal.
